# LibraryTraining
My 3rd year final programming Assignment which I received 90% for, no additional updates have been made since it was marked 

You cna find the project assignment rubric and instuctions in the POE.pdf file

You will need to download the entire .ZIP folder
You then need to enter into the Debug folder and run LibraryTraining.exe
The Application is safe to run and should work
Follow the instructions given in the Application 
No odifications have been done to the Folder since i handed it in for marking
